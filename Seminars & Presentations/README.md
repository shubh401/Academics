# Academic Seminars & Presentations

### This folder contains presentations and discussions on different security issues and problem statements in different context and platforms as follows:

1. **Joint Advances in Web Security - Winter, 2018 (Course Instructor - Dr.-Ing. Ben Stock)**:

    The presentation focusses on a large scale research study performed by [Jagpal et al.](https://www.usenix.org/node/190985) in 2015 to detect and identify the malicious usage of browser extensions on Google Chrome. Further, in the report, we describe an extended overview of this abuse pattern over time and across vendor-platforms such as research work by [Buyakkayhan et al.](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/crossfire-analysis-firefox-extension-reuse-vulnerabilities.pdf) and others.

2. **Web Security - Winter, 2019 (Organized by International Max Planck Research School)**:

    We discuss one of the recent works on the third-party cookie policies employed by web applications on the Internet by [Franken at al.](https://www.usenix.org/node/217649) and the security and privacy issues that surround them. We further review other associated and more recent works such as by [Mladenov et al.](https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/ei/veroeffentlichungen/2019/06/28/PDF_Signature.pdf) & [Luo et al.](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ndss2019_01A-4_Luo_paper.pdf) in 2019.

3. **Secure Messaging - Summer, 2019 (Course Instructor -  Prof. Dr. Cas Cremers)**:

    We discuss different deniable key exchange mechanisms that could be applied to the secure messaging scheme from cryptographic design perspective based on one of the works by [Unger et al.](https://www.cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/dake-ccs15.pdf) in 2015. We further outline further works to address this problem statement, proposed over time.

4. **Selected Topics in Mobile Security - Summer, 2020 (Course Instructor -  Dr.-Ing. Sven Bugiel)**:

    In this seminar work, we review the permission models of Android in its evolution and revolution to identify and address several privacy and security issues discovered over time. We specifically discuss the research works by [Zhou et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221648256_Taming_Information-Stealing_Smartphone_Applications_on_Android) in 2011 that outlines the privacy issues and [Bugiel et al.](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2012/ndss-2012-programme/towards-taming-privilege-escalation-attacks-android/) in 2012 which describes the security issues related to permissions assigned to applications on mobile devices.
