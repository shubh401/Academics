# Privacy Enhancing Techniques (PETs) - Summer, 2019 (Course Instructor - Dr. Yang Zhang)

#### This course project focussed on author-profiling as how individual-specific information such as age and gender could be inferred from the text authored by them such as blogs, posts and articles, available on the Internet. We also highlight the privacy-related issues from such inferences without users' consent. 

A few of the project-specific details are as follows:

1. Text parsing and pre-processing.

2. Bag of Words Approach - Embedding Vectors.

3. Classification using traditional ML algorithms - Naive Bayes & SVM classifiers.

4. Comparison of the results obtained from the above classifiers with the ones obtained from CNN with LSTM. 

5. Dataset - [PAN, CLEF'13](https://pan.webis.de/clef13/pan13-web/author-profiling.html)
